/**
 * This logger will be used by the RaceTrack to record all events that occur during the race. This class will handle printing for you, therefore,
 * you should not be printing in RaceTrack.java. If you are failing the JUnit tests, make sure that you are actually using this class to log events 
 * instead of just printing events to the console. If you want to be printing in PitStop, FinishLine make sure that you pass the same instance of the
 * logger you use in the RaceTrack to those classes. ALL events in a race should be recorded in the same logger (i.e. PitStop, FinishLine should not
 * have their own loggers). Due to the extra work of passing around of the logger, it may be good to restrict logging to just the RaceTrack class. 
 * <p>
 * You <b>should not edit</b> this file and should only be using methods that <b>start with log</b>.  The other methods at the end of the file should
